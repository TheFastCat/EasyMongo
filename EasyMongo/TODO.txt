** Refactor DistinctAsyncompleted event and ASyncReadCompleted events into one event

General

    // TODO - Refactor EntryBase (class) into an interface - move it to EasyMongo.Contract assembly. Because of this can remove dependency to EasyMongo Assembly 
	//        in other, downstream test assemblies that require EntryBase. Also may allow decoupling of assemblies from MongoDB dependency b/c EntryBase requires
	//		  reference to attributes here
	//
	//		  EDIT - unfortunately downstream test fixtures rely on EasyMongoDB's assembly to access DataBaseConnection and ServerConnection objects in order
	//		         to teardown entered test data between tests. However once code is centralized the refactored result will be better, simpler
	//
	//        Merge common code into newly-created EasyMongo.Base.Test assmebly. This project will define a common, abstract TestFixture base class defining
	//		  all interface implementations that other test assmeblies derive from and assign specific implementations to within the [Setup] method. [Teardown],
	//        [TestFixtureTeardown] will be defined in the base class TestBase -- this will greatly simplify the scaffolding of all Testing assemblies within the 
	//		  .sln
	//
    // TODO - Decouple DatabaseConnection and ServerConnection into async implmentations  
	//
    // TODO - Rename EasyMongoAsync to EasyMongo
    //
    // TODO - refactor async operations into separate child assemblies:
	//        EasyMongoAsync.Database -> EasyMongo.Database & EasyMongo.Database.Async
	//
	// TODO - revisit purpose of "Create" Method - where is this used and why? Seems like a polymorphic hack to circumvent
	//        poor design...
	//
	// TODO - refactor callback methods of asyncReader and AsyncUPdater to be templated to remove code duplications
	// TODO - refactor ReaderAsync,WriterAsync,UpdaterAsync to take callback Action<,> as argument to Async methods instead of 
	//        subscribing to Connection event (See example of ServerConnection and DatabaseConnection)
	//
	// TODO - refactor WriterAsync, UpdaterAsync, ReaderAsync to handle errors during async operations and return information in case of failure
	//        via Completion event
	//
	// TODO - Add asynchronous constructor logic... so that no timeout ever occurs on object creation
	// using BeginInvoke with a callback method that in turn calls EndInvoke:
	// 
	// http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2e08f6yc.aspx
	//
	// UPDATE - have implemented this construct in ServerConnection class; however a current trouble is that dependent objects
	// that leverage an embedded, asynchronous ServerConnection class utilize it before it has asynchronously connected to the server
	// need to add thread waits untiil the underlying mongoDB connection becomes usable...
	// TODO - combine TestBase classes into shared base used by all test fixtures instead of having repeated code and logic
	//        in three places (MongoDB.Test, MongoDB.Database.Test, MongoDB.Collection.Test)
	// TODO - add asynchronous functionality for Database/Server operations
	// TODO - Warning	1	CA1001 : Microsoft.Design : Implement IDisposable
	//        on 'TestBase' because it creates members of the following IDisposable types: 
	//        'AutoResetEvent'. If 'TestBase' has previously shipped, adding new members 
	//         that implement IDisposable to this type is considered a breaking change to 
	//         existing consumers.	C:\Users\rperyam.rperyam-win7\SkyDrive\Documents\Code\MongoDB.Database.Test\TestBase.cs	15	MongoDB.Database.Test
	// TODO - when future need dictates support of MongoServerSettings for MongoServerConnection, finish implementing MongoServerSettings adapter class
	//        in order to absolve consumer from need to reference MongoDB C# driver assemblies along with our own. I've done most of the work - ServerSettings.cs
	//        but still need to decouple classes defined in c# driver assemblies from the public contract by replacing them with component parts
	//
	// TODO - implement asynchronous implementations of "GetCollection" methods - Connect(), Write(), Read() methods shouldn't be the only asynchronous functions
	// 
	// 
	// TODO - refactor  tests to use TestBase methods for async connections
	//
	//
	***// TODO - refactor asynchronous operations to take argument delegate callback method instead of being Observer/event-driven
	//        using Func<string, int>; currently working on IReaderAsync<T> for this...
	//
	// TODO - refactor ServerConnection and DatabaseConnection to take Exception argument to callback methods instead of string message
	//        to better handle client handling
	// TODO - create post build events to copy .dlls to deployment assymbly.
	//
	// TODO - implement Ninject within the .sln (somehow?)

Reader classes

	// TODO - support functionality of underlying MongoServerConnection.Enabled
	// TODO - add unit tests to verify functionality of Enabled/Disabled behavior
	// TODO - move GetCollectionNames() from IDatabaseReader to IReader and IReaderAsync
	// TODO - add support for iQuery reads to give consumers more dynamic control over querying
